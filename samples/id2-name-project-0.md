# Project-0 Detailed Grades for Anonymized Anonymized

This is your detailed grade for the Project-0.
Please reade everything carefully and try to understand where you made mistakes (if any).
We tried to be as descriptive in the grading script messages as possible.
However, if you don't understand any message, please ask for an explanation!.
The file is divided into smaller subsections next.
Each section represent a ttask/test we examined.
There are task with points and there are other that have zero points.
Thus, if you see a zero that is not necessarily a bad thing.
At the end of this report, you will see the total points you got (this should match what is in Blackboard).
